## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- All stack choices locked: Next.js 15 + FastAPI + Supabase + GHL + CallRail + Stripe + Resend
- Webhooks route to FastAPI on Railway only — never to Next.js (Vercel Deployment Protection blocks them)
- GHL sub-account per client — never shared; created programmatically during admin onboarding
- GHL webhook: verify both `X-WH-Signature` (RSA) and `X-GHL-Signature` (Ed25519); X-WH-Signature deprecated July 1, 2026

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: CallRail-to-GHL trigger integration — exact API call sequence for missed-call workflow needs verification at implementation time (research flag from SUMMARY.md)
- Phase 4: GHL Agency API for programmatic sub-account creation — endpoint and required OAuth scopes need verification; highest-complexity external API call in product
