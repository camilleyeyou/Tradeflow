# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-25)

**Core value:** Every inbound lead is captured instantly, routed to the right HVAC contractor, and followed up automatically so no lead is ever lost.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — lead-pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (lead-pipeline) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 5

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- All stack choices locked: Next.js 15 + FastAPI + Supabase + GHL + CallRail + Stripe + Resend
- Webhooks route to FastAPI on Railway only — never to Next.js (Vercel Deployment Protection blocks them)
- GHL sub-account per client — never shared; created programmatically during admin onboarding
- GHL webhook: verify both `X-WH-Signature` (RSA) and `X-GHL-Signature` (Ed25519); X-WH-Signature deprecated July 1, 2026
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Added sms_sequences RLS policy missing from CLAUDE (1).md — deny-all default would silently break dashboard; policy uses 2-hop join: lead_id → leads.client_id → client_users
- [Phase 01-foundation]: client_users table has no RLS enabled by design — it is the identity source used by all other RLS policies; enabling RLS on it would create circular dependency
- [Phase 01-foundation]: FastAPI Procfile uses api.main:app dotted module path — uvicorn runs from repo root where api/ package lives
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Supabase service role client uses global singleton initialized in lifespan hook — safe to reuse, not per-request
- [Phase 01-foundation]: create-next-app@15 creates src/ directory regardless of --src-dir no flag; all files live under apps/web/src/ with @/* alias pointing to ./src/*
- [Phase 01-foundation]: types.ts is a placeholder stub until supabase gen types typescript is run after Phase 1 Supabase deployment verification
- [Phase 01-foundation]: middleware.ts lives at apps/web/ root (not src/) — Next.js requires middleware at the app root directory
- [Phase 02-lead-pipeline]: GHL client uses per-request token (not module-level singleton) to support per-client sub-account tokens

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: CallRail-to-GHL trigger integration — exact API call sequence for missed-call workflow needs verification at implementation time (research flag from SUMMARY.md)
- Phase 4: GHL Agency API for programmatic sub-account creation — endpoint and required OAuth scopes need verification; highest-complexity external API call in product
